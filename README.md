# Libft
The Libft project has being been created as basis for further projects at **"School 21"**. Because using most of the standard libraries in C are forbidden by the school rules.
The main idea is to get acquainted with underlying functions in C, their realization and applying.

## Functions
There are several types of them. The most usefull are functions deal with **strings, memory and lists.**
#### Strings
- ft_strcpy, ft_strjoin, ft_strequ, ft_strcmp, ft_strcat, ft_strsplit, ft_strtrim, ft_strnew, etc.
#### Memory
- ft_memalloc, ft_memcpy, ft_memchr, ft_memmove, ft_memset, etc.
#### Lists
- ft_lstadd, ft_lstdelone, ft_lstmap, ft_lstnew, ft_lstdel, ft_lstiter, etc.

#### printf/f_printf

# ***Conclusion***
The project has taught me *realization important functions, work with pointers, makefile and typical data structures.*


All source code was written according to the [school's norm](https://cdn.intra.42.fr/pdf/pdf/960/norme.en.pdf).
